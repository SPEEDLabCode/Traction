{"name":"Traction","tagline":"This is the source code repository for SPEEDLab's Traction mobile network development board.","body":"### This is Traction.\r\nThe Traction module is a hardware development board for mobile network integration.  It contains a quad-band GSM/GPRS radio module, a GNSS (GPS/GLONASS/etc navigation module), an integrated lithium-ion battery charger and a microcontroller.  \r\n\r\n### Why \"Traction\"?\r\nThe hardware for Traction was originally developed as a GSM enabled tracking device for vehicles.  The fusion of the word \"Tracking\" with the concept of vehicle mobility brought us to the name Traction.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe primary authors of the code for the Traction are Affinity Engineering's SPEEDLab and it's employees.  We expect that the development community will provide lots of interesting code in the future, and we're looking forward to including it in the official codebase as it emerges.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
